# Description

This file accompanies the paper "Wetland plant growth in recycled glass
sand versus dredged river sand: Evaluating a new resource for coastal
restoration." Paper authors: Elizabeth MacDougal, Bek Markel, Emily
Farrer, Shehbaz Ahmad, Julie Albert, Sunshine Van Bael. Analyses in this
file were conducted by Elizabeth MacDougal, with advising from Emily
Farrer and Sunshine Van Bael. Corresponding author: Elizabeth MacDougal,
[emacdougal\@tulane.edu](mailto:emacdougal@tulane.edu){.email}

The data come from the second experiment described in the paper.
Contributions to Nutrient Analyses for the experiment were as follows:

Funding was provided by National Science Foundation Convergence
Accelerator Program Award Number 2137730.

-   EM planned plant nutrient sampling, which was conducted by lab
    members.

-   EM sampled soils for nutrients.

-   EM ordered soil and plant nutrient testing from LSU's Soil Testing
    and Plant Analysis Lab.

## Purpose of this File

This file includes all analyses described in the paper. It serves to
provide more detail to those who are curious, and to help others
reproduce the results.

# Environment Setup

Define options for contrasts

```{r, include=FALSE}
options(contrasts = c("contr.helmert", "contr.poly"))

```

Libraries Used

```{r, warning=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(dplyr)  #DATA ORGANIZATION %>% symbol is used for "piping."

library(tidyverse) #PLOTTING DATA. Useful for customizing plots
library(ggrepel) #PLOTTING DATA. Keeps labels from overlapping

### Data Description

See paper for methods on nutrient extraction.

| Column Header | Description |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Substrate | Correlates with Soil Type in paper. D = Dredge, M = Mid-range glass/dredge mix, G = Mid-range coarse glass |
| Al | Aluminum (mg/kg) |
| As | Arsenic (mg/kg) |
| B | Boron (mg/kg) |
| Cd | Cadmium (mg/kg) |
| Ca | Calcium (%) |
| C | Carbon (%) |
| Cu | Copper (mg/kg) |
| Fe | Iron (mg/kg) |
| Pb | Lead (mg/kg) |
| Mg | Magnesium (%) |
| Mn | Manganese (mg/kg) |
| Mo | Molybdenum (mg/kg) |
| Ni | Nickel (mg/kg) |
| N | Nitrogen (%) |
| P | Phosphorus (%) |
| K | Potassium (%) |
| Se | Selenium (mg/kg) |
| Na | Sodium (mg/kg) |
| S | Sulfur (%) |
| Zn | Zinc (mg/kg) |

### Data Prep

#### Assign Data to a Variable

```{r}
plantnutrients <- read.csv("./LSUPlantNutrients.csv",stringsAsFactors = T, header=T)%>%
  group_by(Substrate)

```

#### Straighten up the Data

```{r}
plantnutrients$Substrate <- factor(plantnutrients$Substrate, levels=c("G","M","D"))
plantnutrients_detected <- plantnutrients[,!(names(plantnutrients) %in% c("As","Cd","Pb","Mo","Se"))]

plantnutrients_detected$Ni <- as.numeric(plantnutrients_detected$Ni)

plantnutrients_detected$Na<- as.numeric(plantnutrients_detected$Na)
```

### PCA to plot

I am trying to reduce multiple variables per sample into a two
dimensional plot, so this is the appropriate choice. I will not be able
to have a response variable here, but that is actually fine for a PCA.

```{r, plant pca}
# PCA
plantenv <- plantnutrients_detected[,c(2:16)]
plantcat <- c("D","D","D","D","D","M","M","M","M","M","G","G","G","G","G")
plantcat <- factor(plantcat, levels = c("D","M","G"))

plantenv.pca <- rda(plantenv, scale = TRUE)
summary(plantenv.pca)

species_scores1<-data.frame(scores(plantenv.pca,scaling=1)$species,labels=rownames(scores(plantenv.pca,scaling=1)$species))

site_scores1 <- data.frame(scores(plantenv.pca,scaling=1)$sites, labels=c("D1","D2","D3","D4","D5","M1","M2","M3","M4","M5","G1","G2","G3","G4","G5"))

myplantpcacolors <- c("skyblue3","goldenrod2","chartreuse3")

ggplot() + 
  ggtitle("Plant Nutrients Site Scores") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(0), color = "grey70", linetype = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0), color = "grey70", linetype = 2) +  
  xlab("PC1 (34.05%)") + 
  ylab("PC2 (18.64%)") +  
  geom_point(data=site_scores1, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=labels, color=plantcat, shape = plantcat),show.legend=FALSE, size=6) +
  scale_color_manual(values = myplantpcacolors) +
  geom_segment(data=species_scores1, aes(x=0, y=0, xend=PC1, yend=PC2), colour="black", linewidth=0.4, arrow=arrow(length=unit(.15,"cm"))) +
  geom_text_repel(data=species_scores1, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=labels), size=5,colour="black")+
  theme_bw()
```

### Permanova to Determine Differences

```{r}
adonis2(plantenv ~ plantcat, data=plantcat)
#plant groups differ (F2,12=15.745.1, p = 0.003)
```

## Soil Samples

### Data Description

See paper for methods on nutrient extraction. Soils were sampled from
bags containing the mix types used in the experiment. They were sampled
after the experiment, but the specific soil sampled was extra that had
not been used in the experiment.

| Column Header | Description |
|----|----|
| Sample |  |
| Soil Type | D = Dredge, M = Mid-range glass/dredge mix, G = Mid-range coarse glass |
| Ca | Calcium (ppm) |
| Cu | Copper (ppm) |
| Mg | Magnesium (ppm) |
| pH | pH measured from 1:1 soil:water solution |
| P | Phosphorus (ppm) |
| K | Potassium (ppm) |
| Na | Sodium (ppm) |
| S | Sulfur (ppm) |
| Zn | Zinc (ppm) |
| OM | Organic Matter (%) |
| As | Arsenic (ppm) |
| Cd | Cadmium (ppm) |
| Pb | Lead (ppm) |
| Ni | Nickel (ppm) |
| Zn_HCl | Zinc (ppm), extracted with HCl |

### Data Prep

#### Assign Data to a Variable

```{r}
soils <- read.csv("./Soil_Combined_LSU.csv",stringsAsFactors = T, header=T)%>%
  group_by(SoilType)
#use strings as factors = T, it makes them factors not characters
```

#### Straighten up the Data

```{r}
soils$SoilType <- factor(soils$SoilType, levels=c("G","M","D"))
```

## PCA

```{r,soil ordination}
soilenv <- soils[,3:17]

soilcat <- c("D","D","D","M","M","M","G","G","G")
soilcat <- factor(soilcat, levels = c("D","M","G"))

soilenv.rda <- rda(soilenv, scale = TRUE)
summary(soilenv.rda)
screeplot(soilenv.rda)
abline(a=1,b=0)
#scaling to compare "sites" (samples)
species_scores1<-data.frame(scores(soilenv.rda,scaling=1)$species,labels=rownames(scores(soilenv.rda,scaling=1)$species))

site_scores1 <- data.frame(scores(soilenv.rda,scaling=1)$sites, labels=c("D1","D2","D3","M1","M2","M3","G1","G2","G3"))

mysoilpcacolors <- c("skyblue3","goldenrod2","chartreuse3")

ggplot() + 
  ggtitle("Soil Nutrients Site Scores") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = c(0), color = "grey70", linetype = 2) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = c(0), color = "grey70", linetype = 2) +  
  xlab("PC1 (57.2%)") + 
  ylab("PC2 (24.7%)") +  
  geom_point(data=site_scores1, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=labels, color=soilcat, shape = soilcat),show.legend=FALSE, size=6) +
  scale_color_manual(values = mysoilpcacolors) +
  geom_segment(data=species_scores1, aes(x=0, y=0, xend=PC1, yend=PC2), colour="black", size=0.4, arrow=arrow(length=unit(.15,"cm"))) +
  geom_text_repel(data=species_scores1, aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=labels), size=5,colour="black")+
  theme_bw()
```

## PERMANOVA

Do my groups differ?

```{r}
adonis2(soilenv ~ soilcat, data=soilcat)
#soil groups differ (F2,6=197.1, p = 0.003)
```
